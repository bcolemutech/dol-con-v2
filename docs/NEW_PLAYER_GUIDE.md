## Tips for New Players

### Stamina Management

- **Don't explore on low stamina** - You'll be weak in combat
- **Camp when needed** - It's free and helps you survive
- **Use inns** - Better recovery than camping
- **Watch your stamina bar** - Keep it above 50% when exploring

### Combat Strategy

- **Attack weaker enemies first** - Reduce incoming damage
- **Defend when hurt** - +2 AC can save your life
- **Know when to flee** - Better to retreat than lose
- **Check enemy CR** - Higher numbers mean tougher fights

### Exploration Advice

- **Start near the City of Light** - Easier enemies close to civilization
- **Don't go too far too fast** - Danger increases with distance
- **Explore burgs first** - Safe services and supplies
- **Build up before venturing out** - Better equipment helps

### Economy Tips

- **Sell unwanted items** - Clear inventory space
- **Buy better gear** - Higher rarity = better stats
