## World & Geography

### Cell

A single tile on the world map representing a distinct area of terrain. Each cell has a biome type, population, and can contain multiple locations to explore. Cells are the basic unit of travel and exploration.

### Burg

A settlement or town located within or near a cell. Burgs contain shops, services, and safe locations for rest and resupply. The largest burg on any map is designated the **City of Light**.

### Location

A specific place within a cell or burg that players can visit and explore. Locations range from shops and inns to ruins, dungeons, and ancient temples. Each location has a type, rarity, and exploration percentage.

### Biome

The environmental type of a cell that determines terrain, movement costs, and which enemies may appear. Examples include Forest, Plains, Mountains, Swamp, Volcanic, and the dangerous Corrupted Lands.

### Province

A regional grouping of cells sharing common governance or geography. Provinces belong to larger States.

### State

A political territory comprising multiple provinces. States provide context for the world's political landscape.

### City of Light

The largest settlement on the map and the heart of civilization. The City of Light serves as the safest location and starting point for adventurers. Distance from the City of Light determines the danger level of surrounding areas.

## Characters & Stats

### Party

The group of player characters traveling together. The party shares stamina, position, and resources while exploring the world.

### Stamina

The party's energy reserve, represented as a percentage (0-100%). Stamina is consumed by movement and exploration. In combat, stamina determines maximum hit points. Rest and lodging restore stamina.

### Attributes

The six core statistics defining a character's capabilities:

- **Strength (STR)**: Physical power. Affects attack rolls and melee damage.
- **Dexterity (DEX)**: Agility and reflexes. Affects initiative order and armor class.
- **Constitution (CON)**: Endurance and health. Affects hit points and survivability.
- **Intelligence (INT)**: Mental acuity and knowledge.
- **Wisdom (WIS)**: Perception and insight.
- **Charisma (CHA)**: Force of personality and leadership.

### Armor Class (AC)

A number representing how difficult a character is to hit in combat. Higher AC means attacks are more likely to miss. AC is calculated from base value (10) plus armor bonuses from equipped gear.

### Hit Points (HP)

A measure of how much damage a character can sustain before falling in combat. For players, HP is derived from party stamina.

## Combat

### Initiative

A roll at the start of combat that determines turn order. Each combatant rolls a 20-sided die and adds their Dexterity modifier. Higher results act first.

### Turn Order

The sequence in which combatants take their actions during combat, determined by initiative rolls.

### Attack Roll

A 20-sided die roll plus modifiers to determine if an attack hits. The result must meet or exceed the target's Armor Class to deal damage.

### Critical Hit

An attack roll showing a natural 20 (the die itself shows 20). Critical hits automatically succeed and deal double damage.

### Natural 1

An attack roll showing a 1 on the die. Natural 1s automatically miss regardless of modifiers.

### Defend

A combat action that grants +2 to Armor Class until the character's next turn, making them harder to hit.

### Flee

A combat action available only on the first turn of combat. Successfully fleeing ends the encounter but costs 5% stamina.

## Enemies & Encounters

### Challenge Rating (CR)

A number indicating an enemy's power level and the difficulty they present. Higher CR enemies deal more damage, have more hit points, and provide greater rewards. CR ranges from 0.25 (trivial threats) to 12+ (boss encounters).

- **Easy**: Minor threat, little resource expenditure expected.
- **Medium**: Moderate challenge requiring some tactical decisions.

- **Undead**: Zombies, skeletons, and wraiths. Death perverted and denied rest.
